# CheatSheet

## Git

### `git unadd`

`git config --global alias.unadd "reset HEAD"`

## Linux

### Creating a Service

Creating a [systemd service](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) is super useful!
And makes it simple to create scripts that run on reboot and rely on certain system services, like
the network, to be started before your script.

Create `/etc/systemd/system/my-service.service`

```
[Unit]
Description=My Script
After=network.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0
[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=1
User=your-username
ExecStart=/usr/bin/env python /home/your-username/cool.py

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## React

### Testing

I really enjoyed [this read](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/testing-react-hooks/) about what to
test and not to test in React. It also talks about best practices.

Main Idea:

> react-testing-library forced me to think more about what I wanted to test and users behavior. I
> had to think differently and move away from implementation testing (which I feel is easier and
> natural with Enzyme) into more functional testing (which feels natural with
> react-testing-library).
